# Symrobotics

This is a convenient piece of software I wrote during my time at the ALTAIR Robotics Laboratory. It computes the most common matrices used in robotics such as the Forward Kinematics and Analytical/Geometric Jacobians in symbolic forms while also allowing numerical substitution.

**DISCLAIMER: if you intend to do any serious work, you are probably better off by using the excellent [Robotics Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python) by Peter Corke.**
